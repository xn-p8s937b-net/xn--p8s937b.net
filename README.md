## Welcome!
Here you can register your project's GitHub Pages as a subdomain under `漢字.net`. Follow the steps below if you are interested.

## Step 1
Make sure that your project has connection to Han Ideograms. There also should be some contents on the page.

## Step 2
Decide your new subdomain and make sure it's not claimed by somebody. Follow [this guide][custom-domains] to have GitHub redirect to your new subdomain.

## Step 3
Fork this repository, add new entry into the [records file][records-file], and make a pull request.
